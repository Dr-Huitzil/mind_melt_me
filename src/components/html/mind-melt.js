                What exactly is Mind Melt? You may have heard of us or seen our stickers scattered
                around campus but do you ever question what Mind Melt is supposed to be? Mind Melt is
                the melting of ideas, a creative outlet, that encourages people and students to express
                themselves creatively. It all started with a simple radio show on [Otter Media] hosted
                on the CSUMB channel, The Current back in the fall of 2022. It has slowly grown into a
                much greater community that has a passion for music, art, and creativity. We are a group
                of students that are passionate about music and art and we want to share that passion with
                whoever finds us. It all began with music but we are slowly expanding our mind-melting ideas
                into the realms of fashion, photography, and many other creative fields.

                There are features on this website that are inspired by the Windows 95 operating system. Some of the features include:
